# Evidence-Based Development Plan for Zenith

## 1. Guiding Philosophy

This document outlines the "rules" and evidence-based principles that will guide the development of the Zenith application. Our core philosophy is to create a digital mental health companion that is **Safe, Effective, and Engaging**. Every feature, from simple tracking tools to advanced AI interactions, will be grounded in established clinical research and best practices. We will supplement, not replace, professional mental healthcare.

## 2. Core Therapeutic Modalities (The "What")

All therapeutic content and tools will be based on the following evidence-based modalities. We will prioritize fidelity to these models.

| Modality | Core Principle | Sample Zenith Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** | Identifying and restructuring negative thought patterns and behaviors. | `Thought Record`, `Behavioral Activation`, `Cognitive Restructuring AI Feedback` |
| **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)** | Building skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. | `Distress Tolerance Skills Library`, `TIPP Technique Guide`, `"Walking the Middle Path" Exercises` |
| **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)** | Increasing psychological flexibility through acceptance, mindfulness, and commitment to values-based action. | `Values Clarification Exercises`, `Defusion Techniques`, `Committed Action Planning` |
| **Mindfulness-Based Interventions** | Cultivating non-judgmental, present-moment awareness to reduce stress and improve self-regulation. | `Guided Meditations (Body Scan, Loving-Kindness)`, `Mindful Breathing`, `Grounding Exercises` |
| **Positive Psychology** | Focusing on strengths and positive experiences to build resilience and well-being. | `Gratitude Journal`, `Strengths Identification (VIA)`, `Savoring Exercises` |

## 3. Assessment & Measurement (The "How Much")

To track progress and provide personalized feedback, we will use clinically validated and reliable assessment tools.

*   **Symptom Measurement**: Integrate standardized screeners like the **PHQ-9** (Patient Health Questionnaire) for depression and the **GAD-7** (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) for anxiety. These will be used for baseline assessment and periodic progress tracking, not for diagnosis.
*   **Mood Tracking**: Mood check-ins will be multi-dimensional, capturing not just the emotion (e.g., "Sad"), but also its **Intensity** (0-100), **Context** (Situation, Thoughts), and **Physiology** (Physical Sensations). This provides richer data for pattern analysis.
*   **Well-being Measurement**: Use scales like the **Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS)** to track overall positive mental health over time.

## 4. AI & Personalization (The "For Whom")

The AI will act as a scaffolding to support evidence-based practices, not as an unguided conversationalist.

*   **Rule #1: AI as a CBT/DBT Coach**: The AI's primary role during therapeutic conversations is to gently guide the user through a structured process (e.g., identifying cognitive distortions, exploring alternative thoughts, suggesting relevant DBT skills). It will follow established protocols.
*   **Rule #2: Data-Driven Suggestions**: The AI will use logged data (mood patterns, journal themes, completed exercises) to recommend personalized activities. For example, if it detects a pattern of low mood in the evenings, it might suggest scheduling a "Behavioral Activation" activity during that time.
*   **Rule #3: Safety First**: A strict crisis detection protocol is non-negotiable. If the AI detects any indication of self-harm, suicide, or crisis, it will immediately stop its current function and provide clear, direct links to crisis resources (e.g., Crisis Text Line, 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline).

## 5. Engagement & Ethics (The "How")

*   **Habit Formation**: Use principles of behavioral science (e.g., James Clear's "Atomic Habits") to design features. This includes small, actionable steps, progress tracking (streaks), and positive reinforcement.
*   **Ethical Design**: Prioritize user privacy and autonomy. The user is always in control of their data. The app's design will be calming and non-addictive.
*   **Transparency**: Be clear with the user about what the AI is and isn't. It's a tool to help them practice skills, not a human therapist.

This plan will now serve as our blueprint. I'm ready to apply these principles to our next feature. What would you like to build?
