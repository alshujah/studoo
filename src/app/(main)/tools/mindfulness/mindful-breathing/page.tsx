                            Your breath is always with you, in the present moment. By focusing on it, you can gently pull your mind away from worries about the past or future.

                        <h4>How to Practice Mindful Breathing</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Find a Comfortable Position:</strong> Sit upright in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, or sit cross-legged on a cushion. Your posture should be dignified but not stiff.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Notice Your Breath:</strong> Gently close your eyes or lower your gaze. Bring your attention to the physical sensation of breathing. Notice where you feel it most vividlyâ€”in the abdomen, the chest, or the nostrils.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Stay with the Sensation:</strong> Rest your awareness on this sensation of breathing in and breathing out. You don't need to change your breath; just observe it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>When the Mind Wanders:</strong> Your mind will inevitably wander. This is not a mistake. When you notice your thoughts have drifted, gently acknowledge where they went and then softly guide your attention back to your breath.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Be Kind to Yourself:</strong> You may have to bring your attention back dozens of times. The practice is the gentle returning, not in achieving a perfectly still mind. Treat yourself with kindness each time you notice you've wandered.
                            </li>
                             <li>
                                <strong>Continue for a Few Minutes:</strong> Start with just 3-5 minutes. As you get more comfortable, you can extend the time.
                            </li>
                             <li>
                                <strong>Gently Conclude:</strong> When your time is up, broaden your awareness to include the sounds around you and the feeling of your body. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes.
                            </li>
