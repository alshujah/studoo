            <CardDescription>
              This week's theme is about recognizing how often we operate on "automatic pilot," lost in thought and disconnected from the present moment. Mindfulness is the practice of waking up from this state.

              <AlertDescription>
                Our minds are often in "doing mode"â€”analyzing, planning, and problem-solving. Mindfulness introduces "being mode," where we simply allow ourselves to be present with our experience as it is, without needing to change anything.

                    <li>Notice all the sensations involved: the feel of the water, the smell of the soap, the movement of your muscles.</li>
                    <li>When your mind wanders (which it will!), gently notice where it went and then guide your attention back to the activity.</li>
