            <CardDescription>
              Mindful breathing is the practice of focusing on your breath as it flows in and out. It's a simple yet powerful technique to anchor you in the present moment, calm your nervous system, and observe your thoughts without getting lost in them.

                        <li><strong>Find a comfortable position.</strong> You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, or on a cushion. Keep your back straight but not stiff.</li>
                        <li><strong>Close your eyes gently.</strong> If you prefer, you can keep them open with a soft, downward gaze.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bring your attention to your breath.</strong> Notice the physical sensation of breathing. Feel the air entering your nostrils, filling your lungs, and then leaving your body.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pick an anchor spot.</strong> Choose one spot where you feel the breath most clearlyâ€”it could be your nostrils, your chest, or your abdomen. Let your attention rest there.</li>
                        <li><strong>Just observe.</strong> Don't try to control or change your breath. Simply watch it as it is. Notice the rhythm, the depth, the temperature.</li>
                        <li><strong>When your mind wanders, gently return.</strong> Your mind will inevitably wander. That's okay. When you notice it has drifted away, gently and without judgment, acknowledge the thought and then guide your attention back to your breath.</li>
                        <li><strong>Continue for a few minutes.</strong> Start with just 3-5 minutes. The goal is not to have an empty mind, but to practice returning to the present moment each time you get distracted.</li>
