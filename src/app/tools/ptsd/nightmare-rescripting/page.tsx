            <CardDescription>
              Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) is an evidence-based technique for treating recurrent nightmares, especially those related to trauma. It involves changing the nightmare's story into a new one that you can rehearse while you're awake.

                        <li><strong>Choose a Nightmare:</strong> Pick a recurring nightmare that bothers you, but perhaps not your absolute worst one to start with.</li>
                        <li><strong>Write it Down:</strong> Write down the narrative of the nightmare in as much detail as you feel comfortable with. Just the facts of what happens.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify a Turning Point:</strong> Read through the narrative. Find a point in the dream where you can make a change. It can be anywhere in the dream.</li>
                        <li><strong>Change the Ending:</strong> From that turning point, write a new ending. The new ending can be anything you wantâ€”powerful, peaceful, absurd, or even boring. The only rule is that it must be different and it must not be traumatic. You are in complete control.
                            <ul className="my-2">
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> If the nightmare involves being chased, you could change it so that you suddenly develop superpowers and fly away, or you turn around and confront the pursuer who turns into a cartoon character.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Rehearse the New Dream:</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes each day, while you are awake and calm, vividly imagining the new, rescripted dream from beginning to end. Picture the new ending in as much detail as possible.</li>
